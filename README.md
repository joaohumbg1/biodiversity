# Analysis of biodiversity in US National Parks

The following project is an analysis of the biodiversity in several US national parks. It contains data about various species' conservation status and how often they were observed in each national park.

Our data is composed of two .csv files:  
**observations.csv** is a file with a record of various species and how often they were observed in each national park.  
**species_info.csv** contains info about said species, most notably its conservation status and scientific name.

Analysis is done in the Jupyter Notebook entitled **biodiversity.ipynb**
Here are a few questions we answer in this analysis:

**1.** Are species on a state of threat less likely to be observed?  
**2.** Are some categories of species more likely to be endangered?  
**3.** Which category of species was observed the most?  
**4.** Which parks have the most observations?  
**5.** Do we see the same distribution of categories for all parks?
